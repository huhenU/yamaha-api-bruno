# Bruno collection for Yamaha's Extended Control API

This API is used on Yamahas A/V Receivers. This Bruno collection is meant to provide a simple playground for interacting with the API endpoints.\
Endpoints that support parameters are filled with example values and have their required parameters documented in the Docs-tab in Bruno. However, this is only meant for quick reference. Full documentation is available in Yamaha's respective documentation.

Keep in mind: At the moment only the System section of the Basic Control API is included in this collection.

## Usage
Clone the repository and open it in Bruno.\
In order to send the requests, replace the placeholder address with the IP address of your Yamaha Receiver in the Collection's variables.
